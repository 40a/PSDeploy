    .SYNOPSIS
        Specify targets in a 'By' block of a PSDeploy.ps1

    .DESCRIPTION
        Specify targets in a 'By' block of a PSDeploy.ps1

        This is not intended to be used anywhere but in a *.PSDeploy.ps1 file. It is included here for intellisense support

    .PARAMETER Targets
        One or more targets to deploy to

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }
        }

        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }

            By FileSystem Tasks {
                FromSource 'Tasks'
                To 'C:\sc\'
            }
        }

        # This illustrates using two of the same DeploymentTypes, with different options and details.
        # We specify a name to ensure uniqueness of the resulting DeploymentName: DeployMyModule and DeployMyModule-Tasks
        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)
        # This would deploy the folder Tasks to C:\sc\Tasks, without mirroring.
